Drug consumption data shows use of both legal and illegal drugs by people of varying personality types.
Consumption of illegal drugs is a problem that can be reduced by education, and knowing a person's personality 
can help determine which education may be most effective at raising awareness of the dangers and consequences of
consuming drugs. For instance, if a personality test shows person A is likely to use cannabis, then educational 
course regarding cannabis can be recommended for person A.

"X is an interesting problem to solve because Y".
This should cover not only what the problem is, but also why it's important and who cares about it.

This wine quality data set contains information on wine quality and corresponding physicochemical test results.
For wine manufacturers, there is problem of competition like any other drinks and the quality of the wine
gives an edge over its competitors. There are 11 attributes (input variables) that correspond to the output (wine quality)
and while we can't say all input variables are relevant, a regression analysis can estimate the relation between which 
input variable affects the wine quality, and thus one can control the manufacturing process as to
bring out the desired input variables associated with high wine quality
